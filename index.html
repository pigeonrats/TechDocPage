         <h1>Sailor Moon</h1>
        
         <p>Sailor Moon, or Usagi Tsukino, is the courageous and compassionate protagonist of the Sailor Moon series, embodying the power of the Moon and the heart of the Sailor Scouts. Initially introduced as a clumsy, crybaby teenager with little confidence, Usagi undergoes a remarkable transformation as she embraces her destiny as the champion of love and justice. As Sailor Moon, she possesses the power to protect the Earth from evil forces, wielding the legendary "Moon Tiara Magic" and later developing even more powerful attacks, such as the "Moon Gorgeous Meditation." Despite her initial lack of experience, Usagi's greatest strength lies in her unyielding love and belief in the goodness of others. </p>

    <p>The Outer Sailor Scouts—Sailor Uranus, Sailor Neptune, Sailor Pluto, and Sailor Saturn—are a powerful and mysterious group of guardians in the Sailor Moon series, who represent the outer planets of the solar system. Unlike the inner Sailor Scouts, the Outer Scouts are more independent and often operate with a sense of isolation, as their duties involve protecting the universe from more distant, cosmic threats.
